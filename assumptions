- endCol is EXCLUSIVE
- endRow is simply whatever row endCol is on (not necc exclusive)
- we will NEVER write to the same row after circling around (endCol should always be after beginCol when on the same row)
- if a pointer is NULL no space is allocated (RESPONSIBILITY: NULL out all ptrs every time you resize)
- all rows between b and e are allocated (valid)
